## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze the Titanic dataset to uncover insights into the survival rates of passengers. The analysis involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical testing, and the use of visualizations to illustrate findings.

## Methodology

The analysis was conducted using the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, data reduction, and feature selection.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing distributions and relationships between variables.
3. **Statistical Testing**: Applying tests like t-tests and chi-square tests to validate hypotheses.

## Installation

To run the analysis on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tobibiggest/titanic-analysis.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd titanic-analysis
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To start the analysis, run the following command:

```bash
python analysis.py
```

Ensure that you have all necessary libraries installed and the Titanic dataset is correctly loaded into your working directory.

## Key Visualizations

Below are some key visualizations from the analysis. These visualizations provide insights into the survival factors:

## Results and Findings

The analysis revealed several key factors that contributed to passenger survival, including:
- **Passenger Class**: Higher-class passengers had better survival rates.
- **Age**: Younger passengers were more likely to survive.
- **Fare**: Higher fares were associated with higher survival rates.
